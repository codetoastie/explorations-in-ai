# 🎉 Welcome to Zed's Party! 🎉

## The Most Versatile Board Game in the World!

Hey you! Yes, you! Sitting there with a frown on your face… It’s time to turn that upside down! 🤪 At **Zed's Party**, we believe everyone is entitled to fun! So, what’s the deal? We’ve got a board game that’s so epic, it might just outshine your last birthday party.

### What’s the Buzz? 🌟

**Zed's Party with the Gromes** is not just a game; it’s an experience! 🎨 From the fantastic mind of Zed Rodgers (playwright, DJ, international man of mystery), this game is a riotous chaos of song, dance, mime, and laughter. Picture this: you, your friends, and maybe even that grumpy uncle you never let out of the house, and suddenly, BOOM! A party erupts!

**Game Features:**
- **Players:** 3 to 20 (yes, we include that random neighbor, too!) 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- **Ages:** 7 to 107 — fun knows no bounds! 👵👶
- **Setup Time:** 2 minutes – because who has time to read instructions? ⏳
- **Variability:** Every game is a new adventure. Why? Because life is too short to play the same thing twice! ✨

### The Gromes 🚀

Meet the Gromes: George, Humphrey, Veronica, and Bob! These quirky creatures from another dimension just want to party it up on Earth! And guess what? You don’t need to read Zed's Gromes books to join the fun. But let’s be honest, who wouldn’t want to learn about their wild adventures while playing? 📚

### Why Join the Fun? 🎈

1. **Socialize (and Laugh):** Hide your embarrassment in a game of mime! 
2. **No Winner? No Problem!** It’s all about the giggles, not the trophies! 🏆❌
3. **Hydration Breaks:** Need a caffeine boost? No worries! Step away, make your tea/coffee and hop right back into the fun! ☕️
